# FaceMAE-FAS
A multi-modal face anti-spoofing architecture with a spatial-temporal encoders and a unit involved in fusion. The encoders of spatial-temporal extract features from each modality using ResNet34 and Transformer architectures. Augmentation regularization and fusion techniques are used to enhance model performance.
