# FaceMAE-FAS
A multi-modal face anti-spoofing architecture with a spatial-temporal encoders and a unit involved in fusion. The encoders of spatial-temporal extract features from each modality using ResNet34 and Transformer architectures. Augmentation regularization and fusion techniques are used to enhance model performance. 

The data used for this research is sourced from the WMCA database.
The data is publicly available at Idiap Research Institute (https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/data/wmca). The CASIA-SURF dataset is another data source used in this project, primarily for face anti-spoofing tasks. Access to this dataset requires application and agreement through the (http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/jwan/database/CASIA-SURF$\agreement.pdf)
